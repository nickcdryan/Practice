# Recurrent Neural Network

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to get you a neural network up and running in just a few hours. With this neural network, you'll be able to feed in a body of text as input, and as output receive whatever the AI believes is a good imitation of that input text. For example, given 3MB of recipes from cookbooks.com, my recurrent neural network (RNN from here on out) produced
