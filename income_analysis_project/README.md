## US Census Income Analysis

#### Given a dataset of US Census info, predict whether or not someone earns more or less than $50,000/year. Gain insight into the average +$50,000/year earner.

The goal of this project was not to create the most accurate classification model possible, but instead to analyze the dataset and discuss my thought process in a relatively short amount of time.

The project includes careful analysis of a messy dataset, in-depth discussion of tools, and does a good job of demonstrating my thought process through analysis and discussion of tools. Discussion of handling null values, data gaps, insights drawn from univariate analysis, preprocessing, encoding methods for categorical data, interpretation of regression coefficients, interpreting scores, confusion matrices, diagnostics for model improvement, etc.
